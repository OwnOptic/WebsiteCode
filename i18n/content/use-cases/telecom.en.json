She calls the customer service line, navigates a complex IVR menu, and waits on hold for 10 minutes, only to ask a question that could be answered by a simple account lookup. The experience is frustrating for Sarah and expensive for the telecom provider.", "value": "Telecom contact centers are flooded with high-volume, low-complexity queries about billing, data usage, and plan details. This drives up operational costs and prevents human agents from focusing on high-value interactions like retaining at-risk customers or selling new services. This guide will show you how to build a digital concierge that deflects these common queries and provides a superior, instant-answer customer experience.", "roi": "A = Number of calls deflected from the live contact center per month.\nB = Average cost to handle one live agent call.\nC = Increase in digital self-service adoption rate.\n\n<code>Formula:\nMonthly Savings = A * B</code>\n\nExample: If the Copilot deflects 100,000 calls per month (A) at an average cost of $7 per call (B), the direct operational savings are $700,000 per month. This also improves customer satisfaction and frees up agents for more complex, revenue-generating activities.", "implementationGuide": "<h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">The Solution Blueprint: A Hybrid Tier 1 & Tier 2 Approach</h5><p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-600\">This solution combines the power of Generative Answers for informational queries with structured Topics and Power Automate plugins for transactional tasks.</p><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">Step-by-Step Implementation Guide</h5><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600\"><li><strong>Build the Knowledge Base:</strong> Create a SharePoint site with all your public-facing help articles (FAQs, troubleshooting guides). In Copilot Studio, point the Generative AI feature to this URL.</li><li><strong>Build Transactional Plugins:</strong> For actions like \"Pay my bill\" or \"Check data usage,\" create Power Automate flows that connect to your billing and CRM systems via API. Configure these flows as plugins in Copilot Studio.</li><li><strong>Implement Authentication:</strong> To perform account-specific actions, configure user authentication in your Copilot (e.g., using Azure AD B2C) to securely identify the customer.</li></ol><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2\">Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p class=\"text-gray-600\">Create a proactive outreach engine. Use a scheduled Power Automate flow to identify customers who are nearing their data limit. The flow can then use the Teams or SMS connector to send a proactive notification: \"Hi Sarah, you've used 90% of your data this month. Would you like to add a 5GB data top-up for $10?\" with a one-click confirmation.</p>" },
        { "id": 39, "title": "Field Technician Dispatch", "industry": "Telecom", "technology": "Power Automate", "miniDescription": "Automate the dispatch workflow to get the right technician to the right job with the right information, faster.", "technicalLevel": 7, "problem": "A customer service agent determines that a customer's issue requires a technician visit. The agent has to manually create a work order in a separate system, then look at a spreadsheet to see which technicians are available in that area, and then call the technician to arrange the visit. The process is slow and inefficient.", "value": "When a customer issue cannot be solved remotely, a field technician must be dispatched. This process involves creating a work order, finding the right technician with the right skills in the right location, and scheduling the visit. This automation streamlines the entire dispatch workflow.", "roi": "The ROI is measured in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\nA = Reduction in time to dispatch a technician (in minutes).\nB = Number of dispatches per month.\nC = Increase in first-time fix rate.\n\n<code>Formula:\nValue = (Time Saved + Improved Efficiency)</code>\n\nExample: Reducing dispatch time by 15 minutes (A) over 2,000 dispatches (B) saves 500 hours of administrative time a month. A 5% increase in first-time fix rate (C) reduces costly repeat visits and dramatically improves customer satisfaction.", "implementationGuide": "<h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">The Solution Blueprint: A Backend Workflow</h5><p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-600\">This workflow is triggered at the end of the troubleshooting process (like Use Case 58).</p><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">Step-by-Step Implementation Guide</h5><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600\"><li><strong>System Integration:</strong>  This solution requires a modern field service management system (like Dynamics 365) that tracks technician location, skills, and schedules, and has a Power Automate connector.</li><li><strong>Build the Flow:</strong> Trigger the flow from a Power App button used by the agent, or from the Copilot. Use the Create a new row action to create the work order. Use the List rows action with advanced filter queries to find available technicians who match the skill and location requirements. Use an Update a row action to assign the work order to the selected technician.</li></ol><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2\">Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p class=\"text-gray-600\">Automate customer communication. Once the work order is assigned, the flow can automatically send an SMS to the customer: \"Your technician, David, is confirmed for your appointment between 2 PM and 4 PM tomorrow. You will receive another message when he is on his way.\" This keeps the customer informed and reduces \"no-show\" appointments.</p>" },
        { "id": 40, "title": "Proactive Outage Communication", "industry": "Telecom", "technology": "Power Automate", "miniDescription": "Automatically notify affected customers as soon as a service outage is detected, turning a negative event into a positive customer experience.", "technicalLevel": 8, "problem": "A network failure affects a neighborhood in Zurich. The telecom company's first indication of the problem is when their call center is suddenly flooded with hundreds of calls from angry customers. Agents have no information to give them, increasing frustration on all sides.", "value": "When a service outage occurs, the best way to manage customer frustration is with proactive, timely, and accurate communication. Instead of waiting for customers to call and complain, this solution automatically notifies affected customers as soon as an outage is detected.", "roi": "The ROI is measured in call deflection and improved customer satisfaction.\nA = Number of inbound calls prevented during an outage.\nB = Cost per call.\n\n<code>Formula:\nSavings per Outage = A * B</code>\n\nExample: Preventing 5,000 calls (A) at a cost of $7 per call (B) saves $35,000 for a single major outage event.

Use a List rows action on your CRM/customer database, filtering by the location data provided by the trigger. Use an Apply to each loop to iterate through the affected customers. Inside the loop, use a Condition to check the customer's preferred communication channel and send an SMS (via a provider like Twilio) or an email. Add actions to post to Twitter, update the Copilot's global variables, etc.</li></ol><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2\">Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p class=\"text-gray-600\">Create a self-service subscription service. Allow customers to go to their account portal and opt-in to receive outage notifications for multiple addresses (e.g., their home and their elderly parent's home). This data is stored in a list that the proactive outage flow can query, providing an even higher level of customer care and peace of mind.</p>" }
