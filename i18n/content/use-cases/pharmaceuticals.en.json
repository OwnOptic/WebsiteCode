The doctor's office faxes a handwritten form to the pharmaceutical company. This form sits in a queue until a pharmacovigilance specialist manually transcribes it into the safety database, a process that can take days. A delay in logging a serious adverse event is a major compliance and patient safety risk.", "value": "For any pharmaceutical company, the intake and processing of Adverse Event (AE) reports is one of the most critical and heavily regulated processes. This solution builds an intelligent, automated system for AE intake that ensures speed, accuracy, and perfect regulatory auditability.", "roi": "The ROI is measured in compliance, risk reduction, and efficiency.\n\n<code>Formula:\nValue = (Value of Fines Averted) + (Admin Hours Saved * Hourly Cost)</code>\n\nExample: This solution significantly reduces the risk of multi-million Euro fines from regulatory bodies like the EMA by ensuring AEs are captured and processed within strict timelines. It creates a perfect, immutable audit trail for every single report. It also frees up highly-skilled pharmacovigilance professionals from manual data entry.", "implementationGuide": "<h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">The Solution Blueprint: A Secure Portal and a Backend Engine</h5><p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-600\">This solution uses a secure Power Pages portal for intake and a Power Automate flow for backend processing.</p><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">Step-by-Step Implementation Guide</h5><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600\"><li><strong>Build the Portal:</strong> Create a secure Power Pages site for healthcare professionals to submit AE reports. Use a multi-step form to guide them through the required fields.</li><li><strong>Train the AI Model:</strong> Use AI Builder's document processing model to handle reports that still arrive via fax or email. Train it on your specific AE report forms.</li><li><strong>Build the Flow:</strong> Trigger from either the Power Pages form or an incoming email. Use the AI Builder action if the source is email. Use actions to validate the data (e.g., check if the drug name is valid). Use the appropriate connector or an HTTP action to create the case in your validated pharmacovigilance safety database.</li></ol><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2\">Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p class=\"text-gray-600\">Automate the MedDRA coding. After the case is created, the flow can call a Generative AI model via AI Builder. The prompt can instruct the model to analyze the free-text description of the adverse event and suggest the most appropriate MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) codes. This suggestion can then be presented to the human specialist for confirmation, significantly speeding up the case classification process.</p>" },

The inclusion/exclusion criteria are complex. The recruitment team spends hours on the phone with potential participants, walking them through a long questionnaire, only to find out on question #15 that they are not eligible.", "value": "Patient recruitment is the number one cause of delays in clinical trials.

This solution directly addresses the biggest bottleneck, accelerating the delivery of new therapies to patients who need them.", "implementationGuide": "<h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">The Solution Blueprint: A Guided Conversational Workflow</h5><p class=\"mb-4 text-gray-600\">This solution uses a guided conversational workflow (a Topic) in Copilot Studio.</p><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2\">Step-by-Step Implementation Guide</h5><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600\"><li><strong>Digitize the Protocol:</strong> Convert the trial's inclusion/exclusion criteria into a decision tree logic.</li><li><strong>Build the Topic:</strong> In Copilot Studio, create a Topic called \"Check Clinical Trial Eligibility.\" Use a series of Question nodes to ask the screening questions. Use Condition nodes after each question to check the user's answer. If an answer makes them ineligible, the conversation can end gracefully. If they pass all checks, use an Action node to call a Power Automate flow.</li><li><strong>Build the Flow:</strong> The flow can save the pre-screened candidate's information to a secure database and notify the recruitment team to schedule a follow-up call.</li></ol><h5 class=\"font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2\">Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p class=\"text-gray-600\">Integrate with clinical trial management systems (CTMS).
